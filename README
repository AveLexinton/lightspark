Lightspark is an open source Flash player implementation for playing
files in SWF format. Lightspark can run as a web browser plugin or as
a standalone application.

Lightspark supports SWF files written on all versions of the
ActionScript language.

INSTALLATION
============

To compile this software you need to install development packages for
opengl, curl, zlib, libavcodec, libavresample
libglew, pcre, librtmp, cairo, libboost-filesystem, 
sdl2, sdl2_mixer, libjpeg, libavformat, pango, liblzma

If jit compilation using llvm is enabled(disabled by default),
you also need the development packages for llvm (version 2.8 or >= 3.0)

If compiling the PPAPI (Chromium) plugin is enabled (on by default), keep in mind that 
it will replace the adobe flash plugin, as only one flash plugin is allowed in chromium. 

Install also cmake, nasm and gcc (version 4.6.0 or newer) or clang

To build the software please follow these steps.

1) cd lightspark
2) mkdir obj
3) cd obj
4) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
5) make
6) sudo make install

DEBUG MODE:
To enable debug mode change the cmake command like this:
4b) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE available: Debug LeanDebug Release RelWithDebInfo Profile

EXECUTION
=========

Using `make install`, lightspark is installed in the system wide

Browser plugin
--------------

Firefox plugin path and Firefox should show it in the about:plugins
list and in the Tools->Add-ons->Plugins window.

Lightspark registers itself as the plugin for
application/x-shockwave-flash and for application/x-lightspark, so it
should be recognisable in the about:plugins page. Its description
string is "Shockwave Flash 12.1 r<current version>". The current
version is now "r710".

Firefox is not able to deal very well with multiple plugins for the
same MIME type. If you only see a black box where a flash app should
be try to remove any other flash plugin you have installed.

Command line
------------

The command line version of Lightspark can play a local SWF file.
Execution: lightspark file.swf

Type `lightspark` to see all command line options.

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

Ctrl+Q Quit (standalone player only)
Ctrl+M Mute/unmute sounds
Ctrl+P Show profiling data
Ctrl+C Copy an error to the clipboard (when Lightspark fails)

Environment variables
---------------------

LIGHTSPARK_USE_GNASH: if set to 1, lightspark will fall back to gnash for older swf files
LIGHTSPARK_PLUGIN_LOGLEVEL: sets the log level (0-4) (browser plugins only)
LIGHTSPARK_PLUGIN_LOGFILE: sets the file the log will be written to (browser plugins only)
LIGHTSPARK_PLUGIN_PARAMFILE: if set, the flash variables set by the website will be written to this file (browser plugins only)
